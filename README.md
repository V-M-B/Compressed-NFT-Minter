# Tech Stack
This  focuses on front-end development, and challenges you to build small applications using industry standard front-end technologies as well as some web3 frameworks to interact with the [Solana JSON RPC API](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCZyftNFV4i4Sygxkr6LdPazw2sLMPyhQbVqFID-yy8QSqf81dxJHUoaAk2ZEALw_wcB). Listed below are the main frameworks and tools you will be working with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)
- [solana/spl-token](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/index.html)
- [solana/wallet-adapter-react](https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/)

The frameworks and tools used to build out these projects were carefully selected because they are the tools real companies are using in the blockchain industry to build out production applications. Even though they may be new to you, becoming familiar with them will greatly benefit your hireability as a software engineer (both within, and beyond the blockchain industry)!

# Getting Started
Navigate to a folder in your local environment and copy/paste the following commands into your terminal:
```
  git clone git@github.com:masterzorgon/solana-frontend-development-course.git
  cd solana-frontend-development-course
  nvm install 20
  nvm use 20
  yarn
  yarn dev
```
At this point, the repository should be installed to your computer and hosted on your browser at http://localhost:3000.

# Workflow
For each project, there is a card which contains a brief description of the project, as well as two buttons: "preview" and "starter". 
* The "preview" button, when clicked, will direct you to a finished version of the project. This is for your reference as you build the project on your own. 
* The "starter" button, when clicked, will take you to a blank page. The pages labeled "starter.jsx" within your repository are blank files that you will use to build out your own version of the given project.

# Credits

=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
